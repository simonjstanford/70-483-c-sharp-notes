# 3\. Asymmetric Encryption

 - Public/private keys. Something encrypted with the public key can be decrypted with the private key and vice versa.
- Slow
- All asymmetric algorithm classes inherit from `System.Security.Cryptography.AsymmetricAlgorithm`.
- A `CryptographicException` is thrown if there is an error.


Asymmetric & symmetric encryption can be combined:
- A browser and server generate their own asymmetric key pair and send each other the public key.
- The both generate a symmetric key, encrypt it with the other's public key and send it to the other computer.
- The symmetric keys are decypted using the private keys. Messages can the be sent to each computer using the appropriate symmetric key.


There are five different symmetric algorithms implemented in .NET:
- Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). Used to create digital signatures. Implemented by `DSACryptoServiceProvider`. Used for compatibility with legacy systems.
- Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Algorithm (ECDiffieHellman). Implemented by `ECDiffieHellmanCng`.
- Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDsa). Implemented by `ECDsaCng`.
- RSA Algorithm implemented by RSACryptoServiceProvider.
