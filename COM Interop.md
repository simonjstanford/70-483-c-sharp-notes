# COM Interop

COM Interop works by adding a reference to an unmanaged DLL (in the COM tab)
to a solution. By doing this you can inspect the methods available through the
object browser. Intellisense also works on some of the content. Dynamic types
are used to ensure that the correct type is used at runtime.
