# Configuration in IIS

  * You might need to install the .NET version the WCF Service is written in.
  * You need to set the bindings. Note that you can create a subdomain and assign the WCF service this address, e.g. services.simonjstanford.co.uk. This means that IIS can have two sites - one for [www.simonjstanford.co.uk](http://www.simonjstanford.co.uk/) and another for services.simonjstanford.co.uk.
