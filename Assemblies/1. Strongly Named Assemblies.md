# 1\. Strongly Named Assemblies

  * A managed DLL contains all the info it needs to run its manifest.
  * An assembly is language neutral - it can be used in a C# application after it was written in VB.NET.
  * Multiple versions of the same DLL can exist on the same system.
  * As assembly can be deployed with media items embedded in it.
  * Assemblies can be deployed by copying it into the application directory or in a shared way so multiple applications can use it.

 **Signing Assemblies with a Strong Name**

  * A regular assembly contains metadata, header, manifest and all types.
  * A strong-named assembly is signed with a public/private key pair to uniquely identify the publisher.
  * The strong name is the simple name of the assembly, its version number, culture info, public key and digital signature.

Advantages:

  * Guarantees uniqueness. The private key is used to generate the name.
  * Protects versioning lineage. As you have the private key you are the only one who can distribute updates. Users are guaranteed that an update comes from the same publisher.
  * The digital signature means that .NET can check to see if the assembly has been changed since it was signed. 

 **How to Sign an Assembly**

  * A strongly named assembly is created by using a private key to sign it. Users can verify the assembly using the public key that is distributed with the DLL.
  * Assemblies are signed in the property page for a project -> Signing tab.
  * A strong named assembly can only reference other strong named assemblies. This is to prevent a depending assembly being changed to modify the behaviour of a strong named assembly. If you try to reference an assembly that isn't strongly named then a FileLoadException is thrown.
  * sn.exe is the strong naming command line tool and is the installed with Visual Studio.

 
You first need to generate a key pair. This is usually a file with an .snk
extension. You can do this via the property page for a project -> Signing tab
or it can be generated with the command:

    sn -k myKey.snk
  
![noteattachment1][a8da3db9ed61dafe856adff916eed14e]

You then choose the .snk file as the key file to use for an assembly in it's
project properties -> Signing tab.

When done, you can view the public key using sn.exe (note that the arguments
are case sensitive):

  

  

sn -Tp
"C:\Users\simon\Dropbox\Coding\70-483\SecureStringExample\SecureStringExample\bin\Debug\SecureStringExample.exe"

Public key token is d2b85255605ec9dd

  

  

The public key token is a small string that represents the public key. It is
created by hashing the public key and taking the last eight bytes. You store
only this when referencing another assembly. This saves space in the manifest.
