# Authenticode

A strong named assembly doesn't prove that an assembly comes from the original
publisher - it only proves that the person  who created the assembly had
access to the private key. Authenticode is a technology that uses digital
certificates to identify the publisher of an application. This is done by
buying a certificate online.
