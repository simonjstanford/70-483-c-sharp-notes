# 2\. Connecting to a Database

You need a connection string. Connections in .NET all inherit from the
DbConnection base class. SqlConnection is used to connection to a SQL Server
database. Connections must be closed after use - they are not managed. The
DbConnection class implements IDisposable so is automatically closed by a
using statement.

If necessary, connection strings can be built using a class that derives from
DbConnectionStringBuilder, e.g. OracleConnectionStringBuilder or
SqlConnectionStringBuilder.

  

var stringBuilder = new SqlConnectionStringBuilder();

  

stringBuilder.DataSource = @"(localdb)\v11.0";

stringBuilder.InitialCatalog = "ProgrammingInCSharp";

  

string connectionString = stringBuilder.ToString();

  

Best practice is to not create connection strings programmatically, but to
store them in app.config or web.config:

  

<configuration>

    <connectionStrings>

        <add name="testConnectionString"

             providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"

             connectionString="Data Source=(localdb)\v11.0;Initial Catalog=ProgrammingInCSharp;" />

    </connectionStrings>

</configuration>

  

You can then access them through the System.Configuration.dll. Connection
strings can be accessed by index or name:

  

string connectionString =
ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["testConnectionString"].ConnectionString;

  

 **Connection Pools**

SQL Server enables connection pooling by default. This is an optimisation
technique that maintains a pool of connections. When someone requests a
connection and there is already an open connection in the pool then the
connection is reused. This stops connections being created on each request.
