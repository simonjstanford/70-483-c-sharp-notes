# 5\. Updating Data

Inserts, updates and deletes are done through `SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery()` or `SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQueryAsync()`. You get an integer back of how many rows are affected by your last query. If you execute a stored procedure or chain multiple SQL statements together you will only get the number of records affected by the last query. Note the use of the parameterised query - this is more secure and performs better as SQL Server gets a more generic query where there is more likely to be a pre-compiled execution plan.  

In the example below, you can also specify that the `SqlCommand` object is executing a stored procedure by setting `SqlCommand.CommandType`.

```csharp
string connectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["testConnectionString"].ConnectionString;

using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("INSERT INTO contacts.person
                                        (
                                             [FirstName],
                                             [LastName]
                                        )
                                        VALUES
                                        (
                                             @first_name,
                                             @last_name
                                        );", connection);
    await connection.OpenAsync();

    command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@first_name", "Simon");
    command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@last_name", "Stanford");

    int numberOfRowsInserted = 0;

    try
    {
        numberOfRowsInserted = await command.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();

    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        throw;
    }

    Console.WriteLine("Inserted {0} rows", numberOfRowsInserted);
}
```
