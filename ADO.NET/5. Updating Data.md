# 5\. Updating Data

Inserts, updates and deletes are done through SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQuery() or
SqlCommand.ExecuteNonQueryAsync(). You get an integer back of how many rows
are affected by your last query. If you execute a stored procedure or chain
multiple SQL statements together you will only get the number of records
affected by the last query. Note the use of the parameterised query - this is
more secure and performs better as SQL Server gets a more generic query where
there is more likely to be a pre-compiled execution plan.

  

In the example below, you can also specify that the SqlCommand object is
executing a stored procedure by setting SqlCommand.CommandType.

  

string connectionString =
ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["testConnectionString"].ConnectionString;

  

using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))

{

    SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("INSERT INTO contacts.person

                                        (

                                             [FirstName],

                                             [LastName]

                                        )

                                        VALUES

                                        (

                                             @first_name,

                                             @last_name

                                        );", connection);

    await connection.OpenAsync();

  

    command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@first_name", "Simon");

    command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@last_name", "Stanford");

  

    int numberOfRowsInserted = 0;

  

    try

    {

        numberOfRowsInserted = await command.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();

  

    }

    catch (Exception ex)

    {

        throw;

    }

  

    Console.WriteLine("Inserted {0} rows", numberOfRowsInserted);

}
