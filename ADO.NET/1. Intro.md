# 1\. Intro

Data related classes are stored in System.Data.dll. Data access code in .NET
is called ADO.NET and is in two parts:

  * Connected data. This is explicitly connecting to a database using Connection, Command and DataReader objects. See: 
    * [Connecting to a Database](https://github.com/simonjstanford/70-483-c-sharp-notes/blob/master/ADO.NET/2.%20Connecting%20to%20a%20Database.md)
    * [Reading Data](evernote:///view/26944639/s226/74855d26-cb8a-42ef-b99c-ada044a778fc/74855d26-cb8a-42ef-b99c-ada044a778fc/)
    * [Updating Data](evernote:///view/26944639/s226/904b866f-33c2-4b3f-8ec3-3a8da3a60c2f/904b866f-33c2-4b3f-8ec3-3a8da3a60c2f/)

  

  * Disconnected data. This is DataSets and DataTables that mimic the structure of a database in memory. They are used to work with data offline and then sync later. A DataSet is created after executing a query in a connected database. This is manipulated in memory and then the changes are sent back using a DataAdapter. See 
    * [DataSet, DataTable and DataAdapter](evernote:///view/26944639/s226/eda6541c-50bf-41b2-8a96-3902fa116935/eda6541c-50bf-41b2-8a96-3902fa116935/)
