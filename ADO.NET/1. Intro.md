# 1\. Intro

Data related classes are stored in System.Data.dll. Data access code in .NET is called ADO.NET and is in two parts:

  * Connected data. This is explicitly connecting to a database using Connection, Command and DataReader objects. See: 
    * [Connecting to a Database](2.%20Connecting%20to%20a%20Database.md)
    * [Reading Data](4.%20Reading%20Data.md)
    * [Updating Data](5.%20Updating%20Data.md)
  * Disconnected data. This is DataSets and DataTables that mimic the structure of a database in memory. They are used to work with data offline and then sync later. A DataSet is created after executing a query in a connected database. This is manipulated in memory and then the changes are sent back using a DataAdapter. See 
    * [DataSet, DataTable and DataAdapter](3.%20DataSet%20DataTable%20and%20DataAdapter.md)
