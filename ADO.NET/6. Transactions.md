# 6\. Transactions

Transactions have four properties:

  * Atomic
  * Consistent - the database moves from one valid state to another
  * Isolated
  * Durable - a committed transaction is stored permanently

 
Use the `TransactionScope` class (in the System.Transactions assembly) to work with transactions. If an exception occurs inside the `TransactionScope` object then `Complete()` is not called and the transaction is not committed. It's important to run the `TransactionScope` inside a using statement so it is disposed correctly. The benefit of the `TransactionScope` is that it manages the actual transaction for you. When there are multiple databases, nested connections or multiple resource types then the transaction is promoted to a distributed transactions. This can have a performance impact.

```csharp
string connectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["testConnectionString"].ConnectionString;

try
{
    using (TransactionScope transactionScope = new TransactionScope())
    {
        using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
        {
            connection.Open();

            SqlCommand command1 = new SqlCommand("INSERT INTO contacts.person([FirstName],[LastName]) VALUES ('Simon', 'Stanford');", connection);
            SqlCommand command2 = new SqlCommand("INSERT INTO contacts.organisation([Name]) VALUES ('NFoPP');", connection);

            command1.ExecuteNonQuery();
            command2.ExecuteNonQuery();
        }
        transactionScope.Complete();
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    throw;
}  
```

A `TransactionScope` constructor can be called that taskes a `TransactionScopeOption` enum. It has three options:

  * Required. Use the ambient transaction or create one if needed. This is default.
  * RequiresNew. Starts a new transaction.
  * Suppress. Don't use a transaction.
