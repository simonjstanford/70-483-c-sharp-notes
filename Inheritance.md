# Inheritance

Declare a base class as abstract to stop it being instantiated. You can then
fully implement methods inside it or declare them as abstract to make the
derived class define their own implementation. When implementing abstract
methods the override keyword should be used. The sealed keyword stops a class
from being inherited.
