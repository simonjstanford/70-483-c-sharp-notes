# Data Integrity

  * Entity Integrity: each entity (e.g. record in database) should be uniquely identifiable.
  * Domain Integrity: data type and value must be valid, e.g. a valid postcode
  * Referential Integrity: link between different entities should be valid.
  * User defined integrity = business rules, e.g. purchase limit.
