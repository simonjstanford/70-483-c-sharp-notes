# Configuration in IIS

- You might need to install the .NET version the WCF Service is written in.
- You need to set the bindings. Note that you can create a subdomain and assign the WCF service this address, e.g. services.simonjstanford.co.uk. This means that IIS can have two sites - one for www.simonjstanford.co.uk and another for services.simonjstanford.co.uk.
