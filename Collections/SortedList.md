# SortedList

  * SortedLists contain key/value pairs but is different from a HashTable because it's sorted and objects can be accessed by key AND value.
  * Objects are sorted using IComparable or IComparer when the SortedList is created.
  * All objects added to the SortedList must be comparable.
