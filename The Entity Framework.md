# The Entity Framework

  * This is Object Relational Mapping (ORM) - a way to automatically generate classes or database tables.
  * Attributes are available to restrict data.
  * Provides ability to load/save data from database without SQL.
  * Helps tackle the 'object-relational impedance mismatch' (the difference between hierarchical objects and datasets)
